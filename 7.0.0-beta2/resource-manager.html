<h2><a href="#overview" id="overview" class="section-anchor">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The Resource Manager dialog, shown below, allows you to manipulate the resources that are bundled with a model.</p>
<p><img src="images/resource-manager/dialog.png" alt="Resource Manager dialog" /></p>
<p>You can store any file type in a model using the Resource Manager. Although each resource&rsquo;s original file extension is
not included in its name, the Resource Manager will remember the extension for other users&rsquo; reference.</p>
<h2><a href="#usage" id="usage" class="section-anchor">Usage</a></h2>
<h3><a href="#add" id="add" class="section-anchor">Add</a></h3>
<p>This button opens a system file selection dialog where you can choose a file to bundle with the model. After accepting
the dialog, you will be prompted to enter a name for the resource (without a file extension). You can choose whatever
name you would like, although no two resources can have the same name, regardless of their original file extensions.</p>
<h3><a href="#export" id="export" class="section-anchor">Export</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes you might want to get a closer look at a resource bundled with a model, or save it for your personal use.
After selecting a resource from the list, the Export button will become enabled, and clicking it will open a system
file selection dialog where you can choose a path for the exported file. Exporting a resource does not remove it from
the model.</p>
<h3><a href="#rename" id="rename" class="section-anchor">Rename</a></h3>
<p>After selecting a resource from the list, the Rename button will become enabled, and clicking it will open a dialog
where you can choose a new name for the resource. The operation will not be completed if you choose a name that already
exists in the list.</p>
<h3><a href="#remove" id="remove" class="section-anchor">Remove</a></h3>
<p>After selecting a resource from the list, the Remove button will become enabled, and clicking it will remove the
selected resource from the model.</p>
<h2><a href="#file-types" id="file-types" class="section-anchor">File Types</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, any file type can be stored in a model. However, most file types do not have an obvious use case in
NetLogo. Listed below are the most common use cases for bundled resources.</p>
<h3><a href="#plain-text" id="plain-text" class="section-anchor">Plain Text</a></h3>
<p>Bundling plain text files with a model is the simplest use case, and can be useful for storing large strings of text
that would otherwise clutter up the Code tab. Plain text files can be accessed with the <code>resource:get</code> primitive
(See <a href="resource.html">Resource Extension</a>).</p>
<h3><a href="#images" id="images" class="section-anchor">Images</a></h3>
<p>Bundling images with a model is one of the most common use cases. One way to use a bundled image is to load it into the
View, which can be done using either the <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/ImportA-Extension" target="_blank">Import-A Extension</a> or the
<a href="bitmap.html">Bitmap Extension</a>. Another way to use a bundled image is to display it in the Info tab, which can be done
using either Markdown or HTML (See <a href="infotab.html">Info Tab</a>).</p>
