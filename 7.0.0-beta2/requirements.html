<p>NetLogo runs on almost any current computer.</p>
<p>If you have any trouble with NetLogo not working, see
<a href="contact.html">Contacting Us</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#application-requirements" id="application-requirements" class="section-anchor">Application Requirements</a></h2>
<h3><a href="#windows" id="windows" class="section-anchor">Windows</a></h3>
<p>NetLogo runs on Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, and Vista. NetLogo 5.2.1 was
the last version to support Windows XP and Windows 2000.</p>
<p>The NetLogo installer for Windows includes Java 17 for NetLogo&rsquo;s private use only. Other
programs on your computer are not affected. NetLogo can run using a different Java
installed on your system of version 11 or higher.</p>
<h3><a href="#mac-os-x" id="mac-os-x" class="section-anchor">Mac OS X</a></h3>
<p>Mac OS X 10.8.3 or newer is required. (NetLogo 5.1 was the last version to
support 10.5 and 10.4; NetLogo 5.2.1 was the last version to support 10.6 and
10.7)</p>
<p>The NetLogo application contains a distribution of the Java 17 runtime for NetLogo&rsquo;s
private use only. Other programs on your computer will not be affected.  NetLogo can run
using a different Java installed on your system of version 11 or higher.</p>
<h3><a href="#linux" id="linux" class="section-anchor">Linux</a></h3>
<p>NetLogo should work on standard Debian-based and Red Hat-based Linux distributions. The
NetLogo tarball includes a copy of the Java 17 runtime. NetLogo can run using a different
Java installed on your system of version 11 or higher.</p>
<p>Start NetLogo by running the provided <code>NetLogo</code> executable.</p>
<h2><a href="#3d-requirements" id="3d-requirements" class="section-anchor"><a id="threed">3D Requirements</a></a></h2>
<p>Occasionally an older, less powerful system is not able to use the 3D view or
NetLogo 3D. Try it and see.</p>
<p>Some systems can use 3D but can&rsquo;t switch to full-screen mode. It depends on the
graphics card or controller. (For example, the ATI Radeon IGP 345 and
Intel 82845 probably will not work.)</p>
<h2><a href="#32-bit-or-64-bit" id="32-bit-or-64-bit" class="section-anchor">32-bit or 64-bit?</a></h2>
<!-- this needs to be kept in sync with dist/downloadPages/index.htmlmustache -->
<p>For most users on Linux or Windows, the 64-bit version of NetLogo is the simplest way to a
working NetLogo installation.  Most desktop and laptop computers made since 2005 are
64-bit.</p>
<p>If you have a computer that was made before 2006 you may need to use the 32-bit version of
NetLogo instead.  To determine whether your version of Windows is 64-bit, see
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15056/windows-7-32-64-bit-faq" target="_blank">Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of
Windows</a> if you&rsquo;re
using Windows Vista, or Windows 7, or <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank">Which Windows operating system am I
running?</a>
if you are running any other version of Windows.</p>
<p>For Linux users, the easiest way to determine whether your operating system is
64-bit is checking the output of</p>
<pre><code>uname -m
</code></pre>
<p>If the output shows &ldquo;x86_64&rdquo; or &ldquo;amd64&rdquo;, you should be able to run the 64-bit
version.</p>
